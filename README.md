# 1.06-Generics-level1-2

## 📄 Description

This repository contains four java exercises exploring generics, non-generic methods and varargs.

1. **NoGenericMethods** - Stores three arguments of the same type. Demosntrates that constructor arguments
can be passed in any order.
2. **GenericMethods (three generic parameters)** – A generic method accepting three arguments of potentially different 
types (T, U, V) and printing them. Shows usage with objects, primitives, and custom classes (Persona).
3. **GenericMethods with fixed argument** – One argument is fixed (String) while the others remain generic. 
Demonstrates combining fixed and generic parameters.
4. **GenericMethods with varargs** – Uses generic varargs (T... args) with @SafeVarargs and a defensive array copy to 
safely handle a variable number of arguments.
